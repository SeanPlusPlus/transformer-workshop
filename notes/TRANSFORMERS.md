# Transformers

High-Level Hierarchy of Interacting with Transformers

---

### 1. Hitting the OpenAI API (Out-of-the-Box Solution)

Use a hosted service like OpenAIâ€™s API to access models such as GPT-4 or DALLÂ·E.
    
- Pros:
    - No infrastructure or training required.
    - Instant access to state-of-the-art models.
    - Scales automatically with minimal effort.

- Cons:
    - Limited flexibility (canâ€™t customize the model directly).
    - Costs can add up for high-volume usage.
    - Dependency on external providers.
    
#### Examples for Hitting the OpenAI API

- Text Generation (Creative Writing)

- Customer Support (Chatbots)

- Text Summarization

- Code Generation

### 2. Using a Pre-Trained Model (Local Inference)

Load a pre-trained model locally using libraries like Hugging Face Transformers and run inference on your data.
    
- Pros:
    - No training required.
    - Full control over deployment infrastructure.
    - Often free (just download the model).

- Cons:
    - Limited to what pre-trained model was used for.
    - Requires setting up local env and dependencies

#### Examples

**Sentiment Analysis**: classifying input text as positive, negative, or neutral. 

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained sentiment analysis pipeline
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Input text
text = "I absolutely loved this movie! It was fantastic."

# Get predictions
result = sentiment_analyzer(text)
print(result)

# Output
# [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]
```

**Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and categorizes entities in text, such as names, organizations, and locations.


```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained NER pipeline
ner_pipeline = pipeline("ner", grouped_entities=True)

# Input text
text = "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and became the 44th President of the United States."

# Get entities
result = ner_pipeline(text)
print(result)

# Output
# [{'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.998, 'word': 'Barack Obama'},
#  {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.999, 'word': 'Hawaii'},
#  {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.995, 'word': 'United States'}]
```

**Text Summarization**: Condenses long articles or passages into shorter summaries.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained summarization pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")

# Input text
text = """
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the world. From healthcare to transportation,
AI is being used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and solve complex problems.
However, challenges such as ethical considerations and data privacy remain critical.
"""

# Get summary
result = summarizer(text, max_length=50, min_length=10, do_sample=False)
print(result)

# Output
# [{'summary_text': 'Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries like healthcare and transportation,
# improving efficiency and reducing costs. Challenges include ethical considerations and data privacy.'}]
```

**Question Answering**:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained question-answering pipeline
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering")

# Input question and context
context = """
The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. 
It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
"""
question = "Who designed the Eiffel Tower?"

# Get answer
result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
print(result)

# Output
# {'score': 0.99, 'start': 63, 'end': 78, 'answer': 'Gustave Eiffel'}
```

Why These Examples Work

1. Sentiment Analysis demonstrates a common and easy-to-visualize use case.
2. NER showcases the ability to extract structured information from unstructured text.
3. Text Summarization is valuable for condensing large volumes of information.
4. Question Answering highlights the modelâ€™s ability to understand and reason based on context.

These tasks are straightforward to implement and provide practical utility, making them perfect for showcasing pre-trained models in action. Let me know if youâ€™d like to expand on any of these! ðŸš€

Using a pre-trained model locally provides greater control over the inference process, allowing you to customize aspects like tokenization, batch sizes, and runtime behavior. Additionally, it avoids reliance on external APIs, reducing latency, costs, and potential privacy concerns since all computations happen on your own infrastructure.

### 3. Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Model

Customize a pre-trained model for your specific task or dataset by fine-tuning its weights.
    
- Pros:
    - Combines the benefits of pre-training with task-specific performance.
    - More flexibility to adapt the model to niche use cases.

- Cons:
    - Requires labeled data and computational resources for training.
    - Takes time to fine-tune and evaluate the model.

- Example: Fine-tuning `distilbert-base-uncased` on the IMDb dataset for sentiment analysis.

---

### 4. Building a Model from Scratch:

Train a transformer model from randomly initialized weights using a large dataset.

- Pros:
    - Total control over architecture and training process.
    - Ability to innovate beyond existing pre-trained architectures.

- Cons:
    - Requires vast computational resources and expertise.
    - Needs massive datasets for pre-training to achieve competitive performance.

- Example: Training a custom GPT-like model using PyTorch or TensorFlow from scratch.
