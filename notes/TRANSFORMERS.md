High-Level Hierarchy of Interacting with Transformers

### 1. Hitting the OpenAI API (Out-of-the-Box Solution)

    - Description: Use a hosted service like OpenAI’s API to access models such as GPT-4 or DALL·E.
    - Pros:
        - No infrastructure or training required.
        - Instant access to state-of-the-art models.
        - Scales automatically with minimal effort.
    - Cons:
        - Limited flexibility (can’t customize the model directly).
        - Costs can add up for high-volume usage.
        - Dependency on external providers.
    - Example: Sending a prompt to the OpenAI API for text generation or summarization.

### 2.. Using a Pre-Trained Model (Local Inference)

    - Description: Load a pre-trained model locally using libraries like Hugging Face Transformers and run inference on your data.
    - Pros:
        - No training required.
        - Full control over deployment infrastructure.
        - Often free (just download the model).
    - Cons:
        - Limited to what pre-trained model was used for.
        - Requires setting up local env and dependencies
    - Example: Using Hugging Face's `pipeline` to analyze sentiment or classify text.

### 3. Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Model

    - Description: Customize a pre-trained model for your specific task or dataset by fine-tuning its weights.
    - Pros:
        - Combines the benefits of pre-training with task-specific performance.
        - More flexibility to adapt the model to niche use cases.
    Cons:
        - Requires labeled data and computational resources for training.
        - Takes time to fine-tune and evaluate the model.
    Example: Fine-tuning `distilbert-base-uncased` on the IMDb dataset for sentiment analysis.
